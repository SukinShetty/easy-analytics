# Current Status - Kambaa CRM Chatbot

## ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **ToolJet is running** at http://localhost:3000 
2. **PostgreSQL database** is ready
3. **OpenAI API** is configured

## ‚ùå What's Not Working:
1. **Freshworks API Access** - Getting 403 Forbidden error
   - Your API key doesn't have permission to access CRM data
   - This might be a Freshdesk key instead of Freshsales CRM key

## üöÄ Your Options:

### Option 1: Use Demo Mode (Recommended for Now)
Test the chatbot with sample data while you fix API access:

```cmd
USE_DEMO_MODE.bat
```

This will:
- Load sample CRM data (deals, contacts, products, etc.)
- Let you test the full chatbot functionality
- Work immediately without Freshworks

### Option 2: Fix Freshworks Access
Get the correct API key with proper permissions:

1. **Run diagnostics:**
   ```cmd
   python check_freshworks_access.py
   ```

2. **Follow the guide:**
   - Read `GET_CORRECT_API_KEY.md`
   - Login to https://kambaacrm.myfreshworks.com
   - Get a Freshsales CRM API key (not Freshdesk)
   - Ensure API access is enabled

### Option 3: Get Help from Admin
If you don't have API access:
- Ask your Freshworks administrator
- Request a CRM API key with full read permissions
- Or get admin to enable API access for your account

## üìã Next Steps:

### If Using Demo Mode:
1. Run `USE_DEMO_MODE.bat`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Create a ToolJet account
4. Follow `CLIENT_DEMO_GUIDE.md` to set up chatbot
5. Test with sample data

### Once You Have Correct API Key:
1. Update `.env` file with new key
2. Run `python sync_freshworks_data.py`
3. Your real CRM data will sync
4. Chatbot will answer about YOUR actual data

## üîç Quick Checks:

**Is ToolJet running?**
- Visit: http://localhost:3000
- If not, run: `FINAL_FIX.bat`

**Need to see Docker status?**
```cmd
docker ps
```

**Want to check logs?**
```cmd
docker logs tooljet -f
```

## üí° Remember:
- The chatbot is fully functional
- Only the Freshworks data sync is blocked
- Demo mode lets you test everything
- Fix API access when convenient
