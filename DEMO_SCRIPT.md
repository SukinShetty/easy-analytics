**Q: Can it handle complex queries?**
A: Yes! It can do joins, aggregations, date calculations, and more.

**Q: What if it makes a mistake?**
A: Users can see the generated SQL and results are always validated against your actual data.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Only the OpenAI API usage (typically pennies per query) plus your infrastructure costs.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If something goes wrong during demo:

1. **Slow response:** "The AI is processing a complex query..."
2. **Error message:** "Let me rephrase that question..."
3. **No data:** "Let's check if we have data for that time period..."
4. **Connection issue:** "Let me refresh the connection..."
